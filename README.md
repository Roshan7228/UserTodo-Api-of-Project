# -UserTodo-Api-of-Project
 UserTodo Front-end and Back-End


 This project is a Full Stack Application developed using React for the frontend, styled beautifully with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components. The backend is built with Node.js, Express and Mongoose following the MVC design pattern.

➡️ Our system offers two roles: Admin and User. Admins have full control to view, update, and delete user data, while Users can only view data and check individual user details.

➡️ On the Login page: If the user is not registered, an error image will be shown along with a friendly message indicating the login failed. If the login is successful, the user will see a success message and be redirected to their Home Page.

➡️ On the Signup page: Users can register by filling in their details — after successful registration, their data will be stored in the database.

➡️ User Home Page: Displays only the data visible to that user along with a clean and simple layout.

➡️ Admin Home Page: The admin can view all registered users and also perform Update and Delete operations. Admin can also view individual user details.

➡️ The system ensures secure authentication using JWT tokens and role-based validation, so every user sees the right content according to their access level.
